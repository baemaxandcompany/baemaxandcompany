                    Executive Summary (Arpita):




                    Step 1 Team SWOT (Arpita):



                    Step 2 (Max):

                    Our forming phase began during orientation. It was here where we talked almost exclusively about
                    ourselves. We went over our strengths and weaknesses, what we liked and disliked, and our
                    backgrounds among other things. Following this we talked about outside commitments and how we like
                    to work as a group, with all of us preferring to get things done as quickly as possible. We entered
                    our storming phase as we started our EY, where we got to see how our group dynamic worked, learn how
                    we’re going to manage our individual and group work, as well as managing different work opinions. It
                    was after the case where the norming stage began for us. By then we had gotten comfortable with each
                    other. Our expectations of each other became clear and we were resolving conflicts faster, working
                    felt more natural. Going forward, in terms of performing, we expect to achieve an even better
                    understanding of MSIS and our learning goals, leading to higher grades and assignment timeliness.

                    Step 3 (Max):

                    When going through our soft skills we were primarily focused on professional, considerate, and
                    efficient behavior. Emotional intelligence is essential for working in a group in our opinion, on
                    top of managing time and stress, communicating and being organized. Getting used to public speaking
                    is also very desirable given the nature of. For technical skills, while we did focus a lot on
                    leveraging using technology from microsoft apps to programming software, we also insisted on how to
                    best analyze and think technically. This includes financial analysis and conducting research. How
                    heads can be just as valuable as the technology we use if we can use them to the best of our
                    ability. For team skills our main focus was to be empathetic and open. Be willing to help, open
                    yourself up to the group, be good to one another. Make yourself want to be reliable for them, make
                    yourself want to resolve conflict, and make yourself want to give your team the best work you can
                    give, be a lead.

                    Step 4 (Austin):




                    We were given the task of numerically displaying our individual soft, technical, and team skills
                    based on the twenty-one behaviors defined earlier. We did this by creating a survey which contained
                    all of the twenty-one behaviors with a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) based on how confident
                    each one of us felt about that behavior. After collecting the data from the survey we created four
                    graphs to display our findings. For the first three graphs our group members were assigned colors:
                    Arpita (orange), Austin (yellow), Max (green), and Terry (blood orange). The first graph displays
                    our teams soft skills with the seven soft behaviors on the x-axis and our scale (1-5) on the y-axis.
                    The second graph displays our teams technical skills with the seven technical behaviors on the
                    x-axis and our scale (1-5) on the y-axis. The third graph displays our teams team skills with the
                    seven team behaviors on the x-axis and our scale (1-5) on the y-axis. The fourth graph displays the
                    average of each team members confidence across the three categories. Through this graph we found we
                    are above average in all three categories. However, we are still striving to improve so we can be
                    the best team we can be!

                    Step 5 (Austin):


                    It is crucial to consider how to measure our performance and track it throughout the semester. In
                    this chart we have mapped the percentage grade we have received for that assignment. Our team has
                    set a goal to achieve above 90% for each team assignment. When an assignment dips below 90% or if
                    there is a downwards trend, we will have to reevaluate our strategy when it comes to completing
                    assignments. We will continue to learn from our mistakes and grow as a result of these experiences.
                    This line chart will continue to be updated throughout the semester to ensure we are keeping the
                    promise we made to ourselves.

                    Step 6 (Terry):

                    When discussing about both the short-term and the long-term goals, our team decided not only to come
                    up with team goals but to include goals we each thrived as individuals. We observed the direct
                    relationship between becoming a better individual and being a more value added member of the team.
                    Furthermore, we also brainstormed on how we could better bond as a team. Although we had many more
                    ideas to put down as our goals, we realistically evaluated three short-term goals and three
                    long-term goals to keep track of during the fall semester.

                    What do we wish to achieve at the end of the core (Terry)?


                    Short-term: By the end of the fall semester, we would 1) be bonding better as a group by trying to
                    socialize outside academical environment, 2) be open to critical feedback on performance and improve
                    as a team, and 3) build confidence to present our best capabilities and to produce the best product
                    for any given team assignments.

                    Long-term: By the end of the fall semester, we would 1) be setting up agendas to better manage time
                    and be more efficient, 2) be creative with given problems to become innovative intellectuals, and 3)
                    have better knowledge on the general IT industry and information systems to be capable of solving
                    complex problems.

                    APPENDIX (Austin):

                    What is the best way to communicate with you?:

                    The best way to communicate with me is through my cell phone (630) 670-9938. If I do not answer then
                    please leave me a detailed message or text and I will get back to you when I can.

                    What is the worst way to communicate with you?:

                    The worst way to communicate with me is through email (akrodger@iu.edu), however I still check my
                    email 4-5 times per day.

                    What is the best way to convince you of something?:

                    The best way to convince me of something is to show me your option is the best choice. Back it up
                    with facts and figures so I can agree it is the best choice.

                    How do you like to give feedback?:

                    When giving feedback, I like to be straightforward with people because I believe constructive
                    criticism is the best way to improve an individual.

                    How do you like to get feedback?:

                    When receiving feedback I expect them to be honest and straightforward with me. This is so I can
                    understand what I do well and can fix what I am doing wrong.

                    APPENDIX (Max):

                    What is the best way to communicate with you?:
                    Text 317-522-8860
                    Email mbublick@iu.edu

                    What is the worst way to communicate with you?:
                    Calling without any notification.

                    What is the best way to convince you of something?:
                    I’ll be convinced if the argument is logical, rational, and thought out.

                    How do you like to give feedback?:
                    Just be straightforward with what I’m trying to say. Say what's on my mind while also acknowledging
                    their strengths. I’d tell them what they did right first then tell them what to improve on a leaving
                    note. This will emphasize improvement in weaker areas more in my opinion.


                    How do you like to get feedback?:
                    Just be straightforward with me. Say what's on your mind, no form or ranking necessary. Let me know
                    what I can be doing better after telling me what I did right so that what I need to improve on will
                    be where I leave at.

                    APPENDIX (Terry):

                    What is the best way to communicate with you?:

                    I don't mind calling or texting. If I do not pick up the call, it means that I’ll get back as soon
                    as possible and simply leave me a text. (812) 955 1823

                    What is the worst way to communicate with you?:

                    Calling 3-4 times consecutively when I am not responding. Also, email is not the best way to
                    communicate with me.

                    What is the best way to convince you of something?:

                    The best way to convince me is to listen and to respect other teammates. Every opinion matters and
                    it can often be in conflict. But when I see people not respecting other group members apart from me,
                    I start to disregard the individual’s opinion and will make it difficult to convince.

                    How do you like to give feedback?:

                    I prefer to give feedback in person, but only when the other person is comfortable with it. I’ve
                    seen many times when people were uncomfortable with critical feedback so I’m more used to giving
                    anonymous feedback.

                    How do you like to get feedback?:

                    I definitely prefer getting feedback in person. If the feedback becomes too personal, I’d prefer to
                    be in a private setting than getting embarrassed in front of others.
