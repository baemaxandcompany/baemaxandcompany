                        <p>
                            Our team has been super excited since day one of classes to excel and develop throughout the
                            semester. Even though we all come from completely different backgrounds, we are already very
                            good at
                            tackling most obstacles. We are still looking for ways to get the best experience out of
                            MSIS so
                            we
                            can continue to strive for greatness. Before each deliverable we plan to devise a detailed
                            schedule
                            and plan of attack for the deliverable. During the deliverable we plan to be on time for
                            meetings,
                            accomplish the agenda set for that day, and becoming more bonded with one another. After
                            each
                            deliverable, we plan on meeting to ensure we have retained the learning concepts and to
                            discuss
                            the
                            outcome of our assignment. Overall, we look forward to becoming very good friends and to
                            celebrate
                            success along the way.

                        <p>
                            In our team’s SWOT analysis, we covered the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
                            to
                            our team. After discussion we believe that our team’s strengths are: communication, similar
                            priorities, ability to adapt to time conflicts and reliability. We talked about
                            communication
                            because we believe that we are open to accept everyone’s opinions and we enthusiastically
                            get
                            involved in team discussions to come up with team strategies. All four of us seem to have
                            similar priorities in terms of getting good grades and making the most out of the MSIS
                            program.
                            We also share the ability to adapt to time conflicts by keeping in mind each others personal
                            and
                            professional commitments. Lastly, we count reliability as a strength because we understand
                            that
                            we can rely on each other for assignments submissions, contribution to group discussions and
                            helping each other improve. We identified two weaknesses for the team: Setting up agendas

                        <h3 class="headerName" style="color:white;">Step 2 Tuckman's team development model:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our forming phase began during orientation. It was here where we talked almost exclusively
                            about
                            ourselves. We went over our strengths and weaknesses, what we liked and disliked, and our
                            backgrounds among other things. Following this we talked about outside commitments and how
                            we
                            like to work as a group, with all of us preferring to get things done as quickly as
                            possible. We
                            entered our storming phase as we started our EY, where we got to see how our group dynamic
                            worked, learn how we’re going to manage our individual and group work, as well as managing
                            different work opinions. It was after the case where the norming stage began for us. By then
                            we
                            had gotten comfortable with each other. Our expectations of each other became clear and we
                            were
                            resolving conflicts faster, working felt more natural. Going forward, in terms of
                            performing, we
                            expect to achieve an even better understanding of MSIS and our learning goals, leading to
                            higher
                            grades and assignment timeliness.

                        <p>
                            When going through our soft skills we were primarily focused on professional, considerate,
                            and
                            efficient behavior. Emotional intelligence is essential for working in a group in our
                            opinion,
                            on top of managing time and stress, communicating and being organized. Getting used to
                            public
                            speaking is also very desirable given the nature of. For technical skills, while we did
                            focus a
                            lot on leveraging using technology from microsoft apps to programming software, we also
                            insisted
                            on how to best analyze and think technically. This includes financial analysis and
                            conducting
                            research. How heads can be just as valuable as the technology we use if we can use them to
                            the
                            best of our ability. For team skills our main focus was to be empathetic and open. Be
                            willing to
                            help, open yourself up to the group, be good to one another. Make yourself want to be
                            reliable
                            for them, make yourself want to resolve conflict, and make yourself want to give your team
                            the
                            best work you can give, be a lead.

                        <h3 class="headerName" style="color:white;">Step 4 Team's behavior/skill analysis by category:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            We were given the task of numerically displaying our individual soft, technical, and team
                            skills
                            based on the twenty-one behaviors defined earlier. We did this by creating a survey which
                            contained all of the twenty-one behaviors with a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) based
                            on
                            how confident each one of us felt about that behavior. After collecting the data from the
                            survey
                            we created four graphs to display our findings. For the first three graphs our group members
                            were assigned colors: Arpita (orange), Austin (yellow), Max (green), and Terry (blood
                            orange).
                            The first graph displays our teams soft skills with the seven soft behaviors on the x-axis
                            and
                            our scale (1-5) on the y-axis. The second graph displays our teams technical skills with the
                            seven technical behaviors on the x-axis and our scale (1-5) on the y-axis. The third graph
                            displays our teams team skills with the seven team behaviors on the x-axis and our scale
                            (1-5)
                            on the y-axis. The fourth graph displays the average of each team members confidence across
                            the
                            three categories. Through this graph we found we are above average in all three categories.
                            However, we are still striving to improve so we can be the best team we can be!

                        <p>
                            It is crucial to consider how to measure our performance and track it throughout the
                            semester.
                            In this chart we have mapped the percentage grade we have received for that assignment. Our
                            team
                            has set a goal to achieve above 90% for each team assignment. When an assignment dips below
                            90%
                            or if there is a downwards trend, we will have to reevaluate our strategy when it comes to
                            completing assignments. We will continue to learn from our mistakes and grow as a result of
                            these experiences. This line chart will continue to be updated throughout the semester to
                            ensure
                            we are keeping the promise we made to ourselves.

                        <p>
                            When discussing about both the short-term and the long-term goals, our team decided not only
                            to
                            come up with team goals but to include goals we each thrived as individuals. We observed the
                            direct relationship between becoming a better individual and being a more value added member
                            of
                            the team. Furthermore, we also brainstormed on how we could better bond as a team. Although
                            we
                            had many more ideas to put down as our goals, we realistically evaluated three short-term
                            goals
                            and three long-term goals to keep track of during the fall semester.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Short-term:</strong> By the end of the fall semester, we would
                            <br>1) be bonding better as a group by
                            trying to socialize outside academical environment,
                            <br>2) be open to critical feedback on
                            performance and improve as a team, and
                            <br>3) build confidence to present our best capabilities
                            and to produce the best product for any given team assignments.<br>

                            <strong>Long-term:</strong> By the end of the fall semester, we would
                            <br>1) be setting up agendas to better
                            manage time and be more efficient,

                        <p>
                            After the case competition, our team sat down to debrief on our performance on the team
                            performance. Our discussion ranged from how we brainstormed and collaborated to how we can
                            improve with the given feedback from the judges. Some key points from the discussion were to
                            1)
                            improve on delegating tasks, 2) making agendas to improve efficiencies in deliverables and
                            having some time to practice 3) listening to and respecting opinions/ideas and 4)
                            integrating
                            with knowledge from the class. Some best practices we observed were 1) mind-set to excel in
                            any
                            given tasks, 2) having diverse experiences and backgrounds which gave us many options as
                            solutions, and 3) critically thinking about the possible outcomes of the solution.

                            Listen to my opinion and make me understand how your opinion is valid. I am always open to
                            listening to others. Always get me engaged in a friendly discussion rather than telling me
                            your

                            Open to it at all times. Just need to be able to understand the feedback rather than called

                            for something I did wrong.

                            The best way to communicate with me is through my cell phone (630) 670-9938. If I do not
                            answer
                            then
                            please leave me a detailed message or text and I will get back to you when I can.<br><br>

                            What is the worst way to communicate with you?:<br>

                            The worst way to communicate with me is through email (akrodger@iu.edu), however I still
                            check
                            my
                            email 4-5 times per day.<br><br>

                            What is the best way to convince you of something?:<br>

                            The best way to convince me of something is to show me your option is the best choice. Back
                            it
                            up
                            with facts and figures so I can agree it is the best choice.<br><br>

                            How do you like to give feedback?:<br>

                            When giving feedback, I like to be straightforward with people because I believe
                            constructive
                            criticism is the best way to improve an individual.<br><br>

                            How do you like to get feedback?:<br>

                            When receiving feedback I expect them to be honest and straightforward with me. This is so I
                            can
                            understand what I do well and can fix what I am doing wrong.

                            What is the best way to convince you of something?:<br>

                            I’ll be convinced if the argument is logical, rational, and thought out.<br><br>

                            How do you like to give feedback?:<br>

                            Just be straightforward with what I’m trying to say. Say what's on my mind while also
                            acknowledging
                            their strengths. I’d tell them what they did right first then tell them what to improve on a
                            leaving
                            note. This will emphasize improvement in weaker areas more in my opinion.<br><br>

                            How do you like to get feedback?:<br>

                            Just be straightforward with me. Say what's on your mind, no form or ranking necessary. Let
                            me
                            know
                            what I can be doing better after telling me what I did right so that what I need to improve
                            on
                            will
                            be where I leave at.

                            What is the best way to communicate with you?<br>

                            I don't mind calling or texting. If I do not pick up the call, it means that I’ll get back
                            as
                            soon as possible and simply leave me a text. (812) 955 1823<br><br>

                            What is the worst way to communicate with you?<br>

                            Calling 3-4 times consecutively when I am not responding. Also, email is not the best way to
                            communicate with me.<br><br>

                            What is the best way to convince you of something?<br>

                            The best way to convince me is to listen and to respect other teammates. Every opinion
                            matters
                            and it can often be in conflict. But when I see people not respecting other group members
                            apart
                            from me, I start to disregard the individual’s opinion and will make it difficult to
                            convince.<br><br>

                            How do you like to give feedback?<br>

                            I prefer to give feedback in person, but only when the other person is comfortable with it.
                            I’ve
                            seen many times when people were uncomfortable with critical feedback so I’m more used to
                            giving
                            anonymous feedback.<br><br>

                            How do you like to get feedback?<br>

                            I definitely prefer getting feedback in person. If the feedback becomes too personal, I’d
                            prefer
                            to be in a private setting than getting embarrassed in front of others.
